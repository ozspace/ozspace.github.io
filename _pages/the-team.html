  Joe Blythe is an interactional linguist specialising in Australian Indigenous languages. He conducts field research on the Murrinhpatha language of the Northern Territory and on the Gija and Jaru languages from northern Western Australia. His research interests include gesture and embodiment, turn-taking, spatial cognition, language evolution, kinship concepts and social identities — particularly as instantiated within everyday conversation and as acquired by children. He leads Conversational Interaction in Aboriginal and Remote Australia, a comparative project funded by the Australian Research Council investigating conversational style in four Australian Aboriginal languages and in English varieties spoken by non-Aboriginal people in the Australian outback. In OzSpace Joe oversees the gesture component of the project, as well as collecting Murrinhpatha data on spatial language.

    Maïa Ponsonnet is a descriptive and anthropological linguist currently based at Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS, Dynamique Du Langage, Lyon). She holds a PhD in Linguistics from the Australian National University (Canberra, 2014), with additional background in Philosophy (PhD Université Paris-8, 2005). Maïa’s research concerns the semantics of expressive language, i.e. how emotions are linguistically encoded across the world’s languages. She has extensive experience working with speakers of Indigenous Australian languages in northern Australia, including Dalabon, Rembarrnga, Kune and Kriol. She is the author many articles and books, in particular a 2014 monograph on the encoding of emotions in Dalabon (Gunwinyguan, norther Australia) and a 2019 monograph on a comparison between Dalabon and Kriol, the creole that has replaced Dalabon.

    Dr Clair Hill is a Lecturer in Linguistics in the School of Humanities and Languages. Clair’s research explores cross-cultural and individual variation in semantics and interaction. It is based on long-term fieldwork on Australian languages, especially Paman languages (Umpila and Kuuku Ya’u) of north-eastern Cape York Peninsula. There are two central threads in her work: an exploration of the interaction between language, cognition and culture, and collaborating with communities to translate this research into useful language documentation and language revitalisation products. Her main research interests include: Semantic Typology; Cognitive Linguistics; Interactional Linguistics; Narrative; critical approaches to Language Documentation; Language Revitalisation.
